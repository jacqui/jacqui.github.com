## The Backstory

Prior to the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, The New York Times typically bought a prepackaged results Web site from a third party partner. This is how the data-specific coverage of Beijing’s Summer Games was handled in 2008. 

In the months leading up to the next Olympics in 2010, they decided to try something different. Instead of buying a pre-packaged site from a third party vendor, they bought a new data feed offered directly from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). While the feed was a little rough around the edges and not 100% comprehensive across all possible data points, it was enough to create the Times' Vancouver Olympic site. 

I joined the Interactive News team towards the end of 2009, and I ended up working on the project for Vancouver. That turned out to mean hit the floor running and don’t stop until you: 

a) figure out if curling is a real sport :)
b) remember what all the sports acronyms stand for (IH = Ice Hockey, LU = Luge)
c) overcome the typical travails of joining a project late, under unchangeable deadlines
d) see the olympic flame extinguished and passed onto the next country. 

Speaking more broadly than my own new-to-the-Times experience, though, this approach gave us the flexibility to incorporate the athlete and results data more naturally in our coverage, instead of siloing it all on a separate domain. Below is a screenshot of our Figure Skating page, with highlighted events and athletes on the left, news down the middle and an overview of medals awarded to countries on the right.

The IOC - or really, it’s data partner, Atos - spent the next two years standardizing and widening the reach of its Olympic Data Feed (ODF), and with that expanded data, the Interactive News department at the Times decided to embark on an even more ambitious approach to covering the Summer Games in London.

I'll highlight some of the new features of our Olympic coverage briefly here - don't worry, we'll get back to them in detail later on in this series. We added:

* real time results data for all sports
* richer results presentation and analysis customized by sport
* syndicated content packages for a dozen media organizations around the world
* fully internationalized and localized content (in several languages including Chinese)
* better integration of results data, athlete bios, news coverage, photography and graphics/multimedia
* more than double the number of sports (36 to Vancouver's 15 in 2010)

## The Challenges

The Sports desk at The New York Times sends a fairly large team to the Summer Games. The work we were doing in Interactive News was above all meant to complement and enrich the reporting of our sports writers. We were also working with the Graphics desk, providing them with access to the historic and real-time data and collaborating on interactives. And then, we were hoping to shed light on some of the interesting stories found in the data itself. Everything from esoteric, quirky stats you’d never know unless you had access to the ODF to common patterns and the like - these were the types of data highlights we knew we’d find once the games started.

However, we had to figure out a way to consume the data feed, parse and make sense of it and ensure the accuracy of results first. Our small team also had a vast amount of domain knowledge to learn: 36 sports, each with their own rules of game play in addition to methods of reporting results in the data. After we had a system for processing the data, we of course needed to present it in ways that made sense to our readers. This involved determining ways to publish pages out to the web with a high frequency of change for extremely high traffic loads. Oh, and we had to do this not just for the Times, in English, but also for our newly launched Beijing paper - in Chinese, and our syndication partners - in Danish, Portuguese, Spanish, etc.

Once we got done with all of that, we could start having fun with the data. Make compelling visualizations out of the stuff we found in complex xml structures. Introduce unfamiliar horses in the Modern Pentathlon -- but I’m skipping ahead. I’ll tell you about the unfamiliar horses once we get through this data deluges, promise!
