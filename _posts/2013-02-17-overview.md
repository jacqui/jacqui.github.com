## The Story

Back in 2010, The New York Times decided to try someting different for its coverage of the Vancouver Winter Olympics. Instead of buying a pre-packaged site from a third party vendor, we bought a feed directly from the IOC that sent results and other info like athlete names and venue locations. This feed was a new offering from the IOC, and while it didn't cover every possible data point, it was enough to generate the 2010games.nytimes.com site.

The IOC spent the next two years standardizing and widening the reach of its Olympic Data Feed (ODF), and the Interactive News department at the Times decided to embark on an even more ambitious approach to covering the Summer Games in London. 

I'll highlight some of the Olympic coverage's new features briefly here - don't worry, we'll get back to them in detail later on in this series :)

* real time results data for all sports
* richer results presentation and analysis customized per sport
* syndicated content packages for a dozen media orgs around the world
* fully internationalized and localized content (in several languages including Chinese)
* better integration of results data, athlete bios, news coverage, photography and graphics/multimedia
* more than double the number of sports (36 to Vancouver's 15)

Inspire a Generation!

## The Challenges
Creating something that can accomplish these features, and do it accurately and quickly, is a huge endeavor. You can imagine that the challenges are many. What I found most surprising about working on the Olympics project was not that it involved a lot of confusing, esoteric terms. The biggest shock? How so many seemingly straightforward tasks turned out to be incredibly intricate and difficult. 

And then, of course, there were the known difficulties we were setting ourselves up for.
